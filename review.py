'''
Skills you will need

---strings & lists---
get item from a specific spot
get slice from beginning to some spot
get slice from some place to end
loop through each item (using 'enhanced' loop AND indexed loop)
use .count()
use .index()

---lists---
create list of ints using list comprehension
convert list of strings to list of ints

---other algorithms---
create list of tuples: (item, count(item))

# TODO open, read, close



# TODO convert all to lower case
# print a small slice to check




# TODO 'cleanse' the data
# replace all:
# "\n", ".", "!", ",", "?", ":"




# TODO create a list of strings (hint: split at space)



# TODO print the first and last item in your list



# TODO print the length of your list



# TODO print a small slice at the beginning (approx 20 items)



# TODO use a for item in list loop
# to print a small slice of your list (approx 20 items)



# TODO use a for i in range loop
# to print a small part of your list (approx 20 items)



# TODO find the first occurence of 'state'
# hint: .index()



# TODO find how many times the word 'state' appears
# hint: .count()





# TODO count how many times each letter of the alphabet appears
# make a list of tuples where each tuple is (letter, count(letter))
# NOTE: you may need to go back to an earlier version
# of the constitution.
# **you need** a string with spaces removed
